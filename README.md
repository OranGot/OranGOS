# What is OranGOS?
OranGOS is a simple x86 OS that I am developing for fun. Please do not contribute to this. Because I will not accept any contributions because I want to learn stuff for myself!!!  
The os is largely incomplete with a lot of "disconnected" files and empty directories
## So far
    VGA console printing
    GDT
    IDT
    PIC(doesn't handle all the interrupts but works)
    PS2 keyboard driver(not fully complete but works)
    Memory detection
## WIP
    FAT32
    Memory management
## Plans
I want the kernel to be monolithic and unix like  
Integrate more zig.  
Support other architectures(not coming soon)
